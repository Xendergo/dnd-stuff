# DnD stuff

## The website

A website that keeps track of data to do with DnD characters that's inconventient to keep track of on paper.

This isn't really meant to replace pencil and paper.

-   [x] Multiple characters
-   [x] GMs can keep track of multiple campaigns each with multiple NPCs
-   [x] HP maximum, current HP, & Initiative
-   [x] Items your character has and their quantities & weights
-   [ ] Your character's spell list
-   [ ] Available spell slots
-   [ ] Allow GMs to make preset NPCs so they can quickly make a pack of enemies or something
-   [ ] Allow exporting user data to a file so you can safely clear your browser storage
-   [ ] List of all spells (maybe)
-   [ ] List of all items (maybe)

## The server

A server meant to add some optional multiplayer capabilities to the website

This isn't meant to replace actually meeting up in person, it's just meant to speed up the annoying parts of games (rolling initiative, looking at people's character sheets)

The server is meant to run over LAN, and should require no prior setup, besides downloading and running the program. Ideally installing the program shouldn't be necessary either so it can be used if you don't have admin priveleges on your computer.

-   [ ] Serve the website
-   [ ] Allow the GM to roll initiative for everyone
-   [x] Allow people to look at other people's character data
-   [ ] Allow GMs to make NPCs in advance and not show them to users
-   [ ] Backing up data outside of browser storage (maybe)
